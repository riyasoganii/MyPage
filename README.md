# MyPage

## Cover Image
The user now has an option to select a cover image for their profile, which can either be one of their NFTs, or a default image from Status. This makes the profile look visually appealing by adding personality to it, and also encourages users to own NFTs.

## NFT Gallery
I have redesigned the app to include a functionality wherein the **user is able to display all of their NFTs on their profile**. (This acts as a gallery display only, providing all details of the NFT, but not as a functionality to bid and buy, as that is not the main goal of the Status app.) Additionally, other users (followers) are able to like and comment on these assets, in order to increase interactivity amongst the users. 

## Followers
**The concept of 'friends' has been redefined to 'followers'** implying that the user does not need to be personally acquainted to another user in order to view their NFTs, status updates, and to chat with them. This would increase community interaction.

## Activity
All of this activity (status updates, upload of a new asset, download of a dApp, activity on a dApp, etc.) is shown on a **new 'activity' section of the app**, which replaces the existing 'status' section of the app. A user can view this section to get updates on the activity of all the people they are following, thus building more of a community within the app, and promoting activity amongst inactive users.

A user is also able to **view their own past activity** on a new 'activity' section on their profile.
