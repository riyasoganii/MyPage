# MyPage

## NFT Gallery
I have redesigned the Status app to include a functionality wherein the **user is able to display all of their NFTs on their profile**. (This acts as a gallery display only, providing all details of the NFT, but not as a functionality to bid and buy, as that is not the main goal of the Status app.) Additionally, other users (followers) are able to like and comment on these assets, in order to increase interactivity amongst the users. 

## Followers
**The concept of 'friends' has been redefined to 'followers'** implying that the user does not need to be personally acquainted to another user in order to view their NFTs, status updates, and to chat with them.

## Activity
All of this activity (status updates, upload of a new asset, download of a dApp, activity on a dApp, etc.) is shown on a **new 'activity' section of the app**, which replaces the existing 'status' section of the app. A user can view this section to get updates on the activity of all the people they are following, thus building more of a community within the app, and promoting activity amongst inactive users.

A user is also able to **view their own past activity** on a new 'activity' section on their profile.
