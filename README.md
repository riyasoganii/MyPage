# MyPage

I have redesigned the Status app to include a functionality wherein the user is able to display all of their NFTs on their profile. Additionally, other users (followers) are able to like and comment on these assets. Users are also able to post status updates. 

All of this activity (status updates, upload of a new asset, download of a dApp, etc.) is shown on a new 'activity' section of the app, which replaces the existing 'status' section of the app. A user can view this section to get updates on the activity of all the people they are following, thus building more of a community within the app.
